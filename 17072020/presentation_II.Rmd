### 10s break before the interesting part

# Research content and impact

### Reminder of the main constraints

* We will get back to them next
  + Mostly when comparing **pros** and **cons**
  + And also why this project

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/main_project_constraints.svg")
```

### Model explanation, let's start small

```{r, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_01.svg")
```

### A brief, brief model representation

* **The model** is composed of
  + An **orchestrating component**
  + Individual and isolated **sub-systems**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_02.svg")
```

### External parties, 1 / 2

* **OEMs** provide sub-systems
  + The brake
  + Engine components
  + etc...

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_03.svg")
```

### External parties, 2 / 2

* **OEMs**, enhance ships
  + Mostly VARs (Value-added resellers)

* **ECU suppliers**, build ships
  + Pure hardware manufacturers

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_04.svg")
```

### Afterthought

* Do we have any **issues** with that model ?

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_05.svg")
```

### First issues

 * **Third parties** involved ?
   + **Proprietary** code
   + Uncontrolled **quality** standard
   + Uncontrolled **TTM** (Time To Market)

```{r, out.width = "89%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_06.svg")
```

---

#### It's not the end
* But, if we can avoid them, it's better

#### The real issues are
* Cars becomes more and more complex
* The more OEMs, the harder it gets to certify the whole system validity
* More proprietary pieces

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/main_project_constraints_01.svg")
```

### Cars becomes more and more complex

#### Let's focus on that for a minute, and see why it's really a problem within the current model

### Current model issue n°1 / 4

#### Exponential communication complexity, stage 1 / 3

* Flat sub-system architecture
  * Good so far

```{r, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/exp_linear_complexity.svg")
```

---

#### Exponential communication complexity, stage 2 / 3

* Flat sub-system architecture
  * Things start to get messy

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/exp_linear_complexity_01.svg")
```

---

#### Exponential communication complexity, stage 3 / 3

* Flat sub-system architecture
  * Game over

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/exp_linear_complexity_02.svg")
```

### Current model issue n°1 / 4

### Concept model

* Unlike the current model, we have
  + Full knowledge of sub-systems
  + Full ownership
  + Ease of intercommunication

```{r, out.width = "50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_07.svg")
```


### Involved parties in the automotive market

* Sock suppliers (ECUs)
* OEMs (or VAR (value-added reseller))
* Car makers

### Pros, and growing flaws of the current model

#### Main pros

* Straightforward integration
* Simple, cheap, and quick to develop

### Issues

* Exponentially growing complexity
* Proliferation of proprietary solutions
* Growing difficulty to guarantee system integrity

<!--

* vehicular systems are characterized by proprietary solutions
* This leads to suppliers that develop and maintain separate software for each system instead of using the same software on every system and dealing with compatibility issues of communication, function and signal definitions.

With the growth in the number of embedded control systems and the degree of interaction, further proliferation of proprietary solutions will require more resources and it will become more difficult to guarantee the deterministic functioning of the integrated system.

### Why choosing that model in the first place

* Cars were less complex back then
* There were no or few electronics
* Car pieces were straightforward to integrate

-->

## Research content, and proposed model

### The proposed model

* Heavily based on modular components
* Complete redesign, no use of outdated technologies
* Based on virtualization

### Virtualization potential

* Secure and modular by design
* Extensible
* Dynamic
* Hardware abstracted
* Load balanced
* Proven technology (TODO: documental proof, like ASIL with anciennety, etc)


## New model market impact on shares

### OEMs current market model

#### As of today, OEMs need to:

* Produce the hardware pieces
* Design the software for it up to the communication layer
  + This requires a dialogue with the car maker
  + This forces OEMs to do third party development
  + This forces the car maker to perform a follow-up
  + A maintenance contract could be required

Query: how I will do fire challenge of those use cases ?
TODO: USE CASES (like load balancing for VMs to unload an ESP (conduit assistance), good for illustration)

TODO: generating automatically code ? Effort is on the model and not the implem
-> My model will generate the model of code. Like Communication manager (meta code)
TODO: Talk about that ^

### Communication with a third party is not always easy

#### This costs
* Time
* Efforts
* A lots of emails
* And sometime a good load of patience

### OEMs market model changes

#### The concept model will

* Free OEMs from most of the software burdens
  + Less work means ECUs are cheaper with a quicker RTM (release to market)
  + Also means less legal issues, obligations, and communication

* It gives to car makers more control over the software
  + Easier to certify a code you fully own
  + More secure (one less party to trust)
  + Can respect the company coding guidelines

TODO: list all implications ?

### And finally, the AUTOSAR license

```{r, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("autosar_logo.png")
```

    * Has to be bought, is contagious, and is required for all parties. (paid 3x time by the car maker)


### Everyone good so far ?

#### Any questions before we go to the last part of the presentation ?

* [X] Part 2/3: Research description and models
* [ ] Part 3/3: Administrative details, timeline and future work

<!--

NOTE: talk about the other domain who did the transition (bay serveur)
Analogy tour d'ordinateur (constructeur / equipementier / assembleur)
TOdo: slide for definitions

(buy from Sock suppliers) (NOTE: replace with the new model by a newcomer ? see network evolution for that migration, between bay serveur to virtualization (70/80))
