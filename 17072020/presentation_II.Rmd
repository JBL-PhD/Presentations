# Research content and impact

## Presentation of the current model

### Reminder of the main constraints

* We will get back to them next
  + Mostly when comparing **pros** and **cons**
  + And also why this project

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/main_project_constraints.svg")
```

### Model explanation, let's start small

```{r, out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_01.svg")
```

### A brief, brief model representation

* **The model** is composed of
  + An **orchestrating component**
  + Individual and isolated **sub-systems**

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_02.svg")
```

<!-- ### External parties, 1 / 2 -->

<!-- * **OEMs** provide sub-systems -->
<!--   + The brake -->
<!--   + Engine components -->
<!--   + etc... -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_03.svg") -->
<!-- ``` -->

### External parties

* **OEMs**, enhance ships
  + **Handle the commands** with socket suppliers
  + **Communicate** with car makers
  + **Develop** the relevant **functions** for it to be integrated

* **ECU suppliers**, build ships
  + Pure hardware manufacturers

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_04.svg")
```

## Current model growing issues

### Afterthought

* Do we have any **issues** with that model ?

```{r, out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_05.svg")
```

### First issues

 * **Third parties** involved ?
   + **Proprietary** code
   + Uncontrolled **quality** standard
   + Uncontrolled **TTM** (Time To Market)

```{r, out.width = "89%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_06.svg")
```

<!--

---

#### It's not the end
* But, if we can avoid them, it's better

#### The real issues are
* Cars become more and more complex
* The more OEMs, the harder it gets to certify the whole system validity
* More proprietary pieces

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/main_project_constraints_01.svg")
```

-->

<!--

#### The following issues are known
* AUTOSAR has a design to address them

#### Yet, we have a design with some interesting potential
* Spoiler: a broader usage of virtualization

-->

### Cars become more and more complex

#### Let's focus on that for a minute, and see why it's really a problem within the current model

### Current model, a complexity issue

#### Exponential communication complexity, stage 1

* Flat sub-system architecture
  * Good so far

```{r, out.width="75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/exp_linear_complexity.svg")
```

<!--
---

#### Exponential communication complexity, stage 2 / 3

* Flat sub-system architecture
  * Things start to get messy

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/exp_linear_complexity_01.svg")
```

-->

---

#### Exponential communication complexity, stage 2

* Flat sub-system architecture
  * Game over

```{r, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/exp_linear_complexity_02.svg")
```

---

#### A parenthesis on a published standard

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align = "left"}
knitr::include_graphics("autosar_logo.png")
```

* AUTOSAR relies on
  + A **network of components** (see `Simulink`^tm^)
  + Regrouped and abstraction of sub-systems as features
* AUTOSAR is also providing
  + An communication architecture in between ECUs
  + A micro system allowing a normalized API on ECUs
    - Automatic generation of code

---

#### Technical solutions do exists, yet

* Potential multiplication of licenses (like AUTOSAR^tm^)
* Each OEM has to be dealt with individually still
* Mandatory design coordination between OEMs

```{r, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/exp_linear_complexity_03.svg")
```

<!--

### This is an old and known issue

#### Solutions do exist

  + State of the art recommends
    - A **hierarchical** design, with layers
    - **Grouping** similar entities
    - Broadcast and, or **shared** communications
  + AUTOSAR relies on
    - A **network of components** (see `Simulink`^tm^)
    - Regrouped sub-systems as features

-->

### Other limitations do exist

#### Design wise
* **Lack of dynamism**
  + No easy software redundancy
  + Deep component have to be recompiled in if changed
* **Heavily tied** components
  + Dependencies issues
  + Forces old patchworks to run along new code
  
#### Development cycle complexity
* **Difficulties to** build a **replay** environment
  + Increased release cycle, less coverage
* **Difficulties to optimize** the whole system
  + More computing power required
  + Less predictable requirements
* **Difficulties to validate** OEMs deliveries
  + Need to be done by hand, each time
  + Error prone, leads to un-diagnosed issues being brought in

### Break nÂ°2, before presenting the new model

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("water_bottle_2.jpeg")
```

## Introduction to the concept model

### Incremental list of modifications

#### 1. Appropriation of sub-systems
* First, we learn how those sub-components work

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_07.svg")
```

---

#### 2. Isolation of every components

* Then, we build a modular design to gain potential
* It's a start, virtualization brings many other benefits

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("umls/growing_complexity_08.svg")
```

---

#### 3. Truly exploiting the benefits of the model

* Finally, we capitalize on that and start to do real things

#### 3.1 With technical features like

* Load balancing |  Dynamic management |  Security
* Static optimizations |  A/B benchmarks |  Redundancy

#### 3.2 And a motivation boost
* It is always rewarding to work on challenging features

### Regarding the project timeline & costs

```{r, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("project_cost.PNG")
```

### Investigations to do next on virtualization

#### Status

* Virtualization is a **mature technology**

#### Some questions on the subject

1. Is it **compatible** with automotive real-time systems constraints ?

2. How much **does it cost** ? performance wise ?

3. In practice, **does it fit** well ?

4. Is it **easy enough** to manipulate ? debug ? configure ?


####

[X] **This will have to get analyzed further down the research**
<!--

* vehicular systems are characterized by proprietary solutions
* This leads to suppliers that develop and maintain separate software for each system instead of using the same software on every system and dealing with compatibility issues of communication, function and signal definitions.

With the growth in the number of embedded control systems and the degree of interaction, further proliferation of proprietary solutions will require more resources and it will become more difficult to guarantee the deterministic functioning of the integrated system.

### Why choosing that model in the first place

* Cars were less complex back then
* There were no or few electronics
* Car pieces were straightforward to integrate


### Virtualization potential

* Secure and modular by design
* Extensible
* Dynamic
* Hardware abstracted
* Load balanced
* Proven technology (TODO: documental proof, like ASIL with anciennety, etc)


## New model market impact on shares

### OEMs current market model

#### As of today, OEMs need to:

* Produce the hardware pieces
* Design the software for it up to the communication layer
  + This requires a dialogue with the car maker
  + This forces OEMs to do third party development
  + This forces the car maker to perform a follow-up
  + A maintenance contract could be required

Query: how I will do fire challenge of those use cases ?
TODO: USE CASES (like load balancing for VMs to unload an ESP (conduit assistance), good for illustration)

TODO: generating automatically code ? Effort is on the model and not the implem
-> My model will generate the model of code. Like Communication manager (meta code)
TODO: Talk about that ^

### Communication with a third party is not always easy

#### This costs
* Time
* Efforts
* A lots of emails
* And sometime a good load of patience

### OEMs market model changes

#### The concept model will

* Free OEMs from most of the software burdens
  + Less work means ECUs are cheaper with a quicker RTM (release to market)
  + Also means less legal issues, obligations, and communication

* It gives to car makers more control over the software
  + Easier to certify a code you fully own
  + More secure (one less party to trust)
  + Can respect the company coding guidelines

TODO: list all implications ?

### And finally, the AUTOSAR license

```{r, out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("autosar_logo.png")
```

    * Has to be bought, is contagious, and is required for all parties. (paid 3x time by the car maker)

(buy from Sock suppliers) (NOTE: replace with the new model by a newcomer ? see network evolution for that migration, between bay serveur to virtualization (70/80))
