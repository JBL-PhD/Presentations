# Research content and impact

## Reminder of the main constraints

* Cost,
* Safety,
* Legal compliance,
* Time to market

### Involved parties in the automotive market

* OEMs
* Car makers
* ???

### Pros, and growing flaws of the current model

* Straightforward integration
* Simple, cheap, and quick to develop
* But
  * Exponentially growing complexity
  * Proliferation of proprietary solutions
  * Growing difficulty to guarantee system integrity

<!--

* vehicular systems are characterized by proprietary solutions
* This leads to suppliers that develop and maintain separate software for each system instead of using the same software on every system and dealing with compatibility issues of communication, function and signal definitions.

With the growth in the number of embedded control systems and the degree of interaction, further proliferation of proprietary solutions will require more resources and it will become more difficult to guarantee the deterministic functioning of the integrated system.

### Why choosing that model in the first place

* Cars were less complex back then
* There were no or few electronics
* Car pieces were straightforward to integrate

-->

## Research content, and proposed model

### The proposed model

* Heavily based on modular components
* Complete redesign, no use of outdated technologies
* Based on virtualization

### Virtualization potential

* Secure and modular by design
* Extensible
* Dynamic
* Hardware abstracted
* Load balanced
* Well documented

## New model market impact on shares

### OEMs current market model

#### As of today, OEMs need to:

* Produce the hardware pieces
* Design the software for it up to the communication layer
  + This requires a dialogue with the car maker
  + This forces OEMs to do third party development
  + This forces the car maker to perform a follow-up
  + A maintenance contract could be required

### Communication with a third party is not always easy

#### This costs
* Time
* Efforts
* A lots of emails
* And sometime a good load of patience

### OEMs market model changes

#### The concept model will

* Free OEMs from most of the software burdens
  + Less work means ECUs are cheaper with a quicker RTM (release to market)
  + Also means less legal issues, obligations, and communication

* It gives to car makers more control over the software
  + Easier to certify a code you fully own
  + More secure (one less party to trust)
  + Can respect the company coding guidelines

### And finally, the AUTOSAR license

```

* Has to be bought, is contagious, and is required for all parties.
